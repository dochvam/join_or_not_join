# Data and code accompanying "Should you use data integration for your distribution model?"

## Organization


## Simulation

The simulation code is organized as follows. 

The folder "`main_code/`" contains files to execute each of the three 
simulations (described in Appendix A) called `run_sim1.R`, `run_sim2.R`, and 
`run_sim3.R`. On execution, each of these will produce outputs and save them
to the folder `sim_output/`. The code files `vis_sim1.R`, `vis_sim2.R`, and
`vis_sim3.R` are used to produce figures visualizing the outcomes of the
simulation. There are two other relevant scripts, `run_apriori.R` and
`vis_aposteriori.R`, which 

The folder `support_fn.R`


## Worked example

The code to reproduce the Worked Example is organized as follows.
